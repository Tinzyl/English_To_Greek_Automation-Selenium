# English_To_Greek_Automation-Selenium
### Wrote a python script using Selenium that does the following tasks:
- Automatically opens the website, deepl
- Automatically closes the popup banner so that the program can run smoothly
- Automatically selects the Greek language in the "Translate to" section
- Automatically uploads a text file and inputs the content in the "Detect Language" section, i.e. the language that requires translation section
- Once the content of the file is translated, the program automatically copies the translated text to the clipboard
